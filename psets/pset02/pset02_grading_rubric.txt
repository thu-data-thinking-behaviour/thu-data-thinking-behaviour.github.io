Problem set #2 Grading Rubric:

  1 points, correct file names, zip files, ect. (this is a all or nothing point!)

  4 points, implementation of additive model (there will be some partial credit here):

    2 points for us being able to run either of these:

      Rscript pset02.R train.csv test.csv
      python3 pset02.py train.csv test.csv

    And reproducing the results.csv. You do not need to be exact, but should aim for a correlation of around 0.9.

    2 points for being able to run this with a new (unknown) train.csv and test.csv and again replicating the results

  5 points, for the questions (one point per question)


Remember, we will drop your lowest grade of the semester and average the
  remaining assignments (expecting there to be 9 total). This will map
  to final grades as follows:

  10    A    H
   9    A-   H
   8    B+   HP
   7    B    HP
   6    B-   HP
   5    C+   P
   4    C    P
   3    C-   P
   2    D    F
   1    D    F
