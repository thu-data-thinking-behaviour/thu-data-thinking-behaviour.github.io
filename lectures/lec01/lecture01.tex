\textbf{STAT 365/665: Data Mining and Machine Learning} \vspace{12pt}

Techniques for data mining and machine learning are covered from both a statistical and a computational perspective, including support vector machines, bagging, boosting, neural networks, and other nonlinear and nonparametric regression methods. The course gives the basic ideas and intuition behind these methods, a more formal understanding of how and why they work, and opportunities to experiment with machine-learning algorithms and apply them to data.

I would not say that description is inaccurate, but it is incredibly vague.
I will concentrate in particular on:

\begin{itemize}
\item computation aspects; both theory and practical considerations
\item machine learning as applied data analysis
\end{itemize}

This will be quite different than the way the course was taught in recent years.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Classes will typically consists of about 30 minutes of lecture followed by
interactive coding, simulations, and data analysis.

{\bf STAT 365 vs. STAT 665}

Same requirements and assignments; however grading schemes may be
different, even week to week.

Make sure you sign up for the correct
course number!

{\bf Problem Sets:}

There will be approximately $9$ problem sets assigned throughout the
semester, due on Thursdays. These will consist of both building custom
implementations of machine learning algorithms, as well as applying
established libraries to machine learning problems.
You should expect to become comfortable working simultaneously in a
number of programming languages. All submissions will be made
electronically on the ClassesV2 site.

{\bf Grading:}

Course grades will be determined based on scores from the problem
sets. I want to make the grading extremely transparent, so these
will all be graded on an 10 point scale (with the possibility of
up to one additional point for truly exceptional work or extra
credit questions). The final grade will be calculated by dropping
the lowest grade, rounding the average of remainder to the nearest
integer and reading off of the following table:

{\bf Grading scale}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c || l | c}
Numeric Score & \multicolumn{2}{| l}{Final Grade} \\
\hline \hline
10 & A  & H \\
9  & A- & H \\
8  & B+ & HP \\
7  & B  & HP \\
6  & B- & HP \\
5  & C+ & P \\
4  & C  & P \\
3  & C- & P \\
2  & D  & F \\
1  & F  & F \\
0  & F  & F
